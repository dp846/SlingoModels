Storing deep learning, pre trained tensorflowJS exports of object detection models for British Sign Language recognition. Also contains the majority of the dataset of images used to train the 2 models for the 2 different categories 'Greetings' and 'Family'. These models are used in a BSL educational platform called **Slingo** which was a University of Bath project completed as a team of 7 members.
